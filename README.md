# Magnitude_Comparator_VHDL
This VHDL project presents a simple VHDL code for a comparator. Full VHDL code together with test bench for the comparator is provided.
The design for the comparator based on the truth table and K-map are already presented here. There are two 2-bit inputs A and B to be compared. Three output signals are A_less_B (1 if A < B, else 0), A_equal_B (1 if A=B, else 0), and A_greater_B (1 if A>B, else 0). The minimized expressions obtained from K-Map tables for the outputs are used for VHDL coding of the comparator.
